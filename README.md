**ENXO Reporting Tool**

This is the offical Enxo Reporting Tool.  It is currently a work in progress and will eventually become the backend for the customer facing site.  This started out as an AdonisJS 4.0 Boilerplate application and is being molded and shaped in my custom solution.  The main purpose of this tool is to provide a web interface for users/accountability partners to manage their device settings, as well as to view and run reports.
