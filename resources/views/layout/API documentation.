This should be automated somehow and run from a bash script or a cron job once a week.  Something like this would work for now:


for i in `awk '{print$1}' /tmp/users.list`; do for x in {0..4}; do echo $i $x; done; done

$: time 'for i in `awk '{print $1}' /tmp/users.list`; do for x in {0..4}; echo curl http://http://localhost:3333/api/report/full/weekly/$i/$x; done'
